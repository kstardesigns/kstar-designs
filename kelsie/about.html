				<p>Hi, I'm Kelsie and my story is unique and special part of what makes me who I am. I have always been well-endowed with a creative mind and the small but mighty hands to pursue my creative imagination. I have always been a story-teller ever since I was young and able to speak. And once I was able to start writing that is when my love for it really blossomed. At the age of 12, I published my first book AWhisper of Regret. This was a big step for me, because this is not something I have pursued to make profit on. This really surprises a lot of people because society has Designed this idea of "Live only to make money,"  which causes a lot of people to stray away from their creative side. And since that time, I have published two more books, both being poetry collections. Unspoken and You were both published simultaneously in the summer of 2014.</p>

				<p>I started becoming interested in photography about the time I published for the first time. I owe many thanks for where I am today in my skill set. I plan on growing my skills and mindset through offering opportunities for new ideas. My overall goal is to give everyone the opportunity to wholly be themselves and to be able to show and see that they are uniquely their own being and to embrace that wholeheartedly.</p>

				<p>I would like to say that I am entirely grateful for the being given the opportunity to pause my creative pursuits and be able to pursue my military career as well. This experience has opened my eyes to different situations and people which is all just another part of growing and expanding yourself to your fullest potential.</p>
