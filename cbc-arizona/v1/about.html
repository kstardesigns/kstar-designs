<p>After relocating to Arizona and building and remodeling churches in the valley, we found our new passion in the luxury home market, and have been building custom luxury homes in the Phoenix valley for over thirteen years.</p>

<p>Your plans or ours, your lot or ours, we are here for you.</p>

<p>When choosing your builder, please consider CBC as we have devoted our construction services to the Phoenix valley. You can trust that we will be on your project and we will communicate with you as you would expect. Our reputation is flawless and our integrity is uncompromising.</p>
