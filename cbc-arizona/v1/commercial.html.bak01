        	<div id="text"><p>With 23+ years of commercial building experience, CBC has the knowledge, connections and communication skills to ensure that your building project comes in on time… and on budget. Whether you need a church for your congregation, office or retail space for your business, or condos or apartments for your tenants, CBC can provide the guidance, management and skilled craftsmen to make your dreams a reality.</p>

<div id="subtitles">Commitment to Quality</div>

<p>The only way to ensure quality is through an unswerving dedication and management of your building project throughout every stage of development and building. Our 23+ years of experience go to work for you, guaranteeing that your commercial project will be safe, energy efficient and to specification.</p>

<div id="subtitles">Green Buildings, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency</div>

<p>We build buildings right. We believe it’s not enough to build a beautiful building – every building should be planned and constructed to make the most of the natural resources we all share. Incorporating renewable energy strategies and energy efficiency gives every CBC building an earth-friendly designation and reduces environmental impact and expense for decades to come.</p>

<div id="subtitles">Your Partner in the Process</div>

<p>Getting your building built is our full-time business – not yours! We will partner with you to ensure your needs and expectations are met, while carefully managing your project. We will consult with you whenever needed, but you won’t have  to worry about the day-to-day workings during planning or construction. You can leave the details to us knowing that we’re on the job until we hand you the keys!</p></div></div>

    <blockquote>"I turned to CBC for assistance on a project arising out of a lengthy and contentious litigation. They did a terrific job in both the planning and execution phases of the project, completing the project in a timely and professional manner, and Vince communicated with property owners in a way that defused, rather than exacerbated, further conflict. I couldn’t have asked for a better result,  and I would not hesitate to use Vince and CBC again."</blockquote>
- P. Dowdell - Firetag, Stoss & Dowdell, P.C.
	<blockquote>"I have retained CBC twice in the past year for roadway projects and they are the best I have worked with. They do a superb job of planning, communicating the plan and completing the job in a timely and cost effective manner. Vince is particularly adept at dealing with individuals who are difficult and wish to interfere with the project. I would not hesitate to recommend Vince and CBC to anybody needing the services of a reputable and professional contractor."
