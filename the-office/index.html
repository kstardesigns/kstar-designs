			<p><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="TV Tropes title drop page" target="_blank">Title</a> <a href="http://titledrops.xyz/" title="Check out lots more title drops here" target="_blank">drops</a> are when a TV show, movie, or other media mentions its own title in a line of dialogue. Among the top title-droppers are lots of TV shows that feature a main character's name as its title (think <em>Seinfeld</em>, <em>Roseanne</em>, <em>Reba</em>, <em>Newhart</em>, etc.). Similarly, <em>The Office</em> title drop count is also plentiful, since the simple title is also the location where most of the show takes place.</p>

			<p>Some quick stats: <em>The Office</em> title-drops <strong>222</strong> times in its <strong>201</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)_episodes" title="List of The Office (US) episodes on Wikipedia" target="_blank">*</a> episodes, or an average of <strong>1.1</strong> times per episode and <strong>24.7</strong> times per season. Frequent title-droppers unsurprisingly include Michael (<strong>72</strong> times): "This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office"; and Dwight (<strong>36</strong> times): "Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence." But there are also a few starring characters like Stanley and Phyllis, who appear in every season but don't title-drop at all. </p>

			<h2>And here are some other fun facts and title drop stats!</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>The 5 most prominent characters in the show (Michael, Dwight, Pam, Jim, and Andy, according to <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/08/the-office/" title="The Office dialogue in 5 charts" target="_blank">The Pudding's breakdown</a>) account for <strong>76%</strong> of all of the show's title drops.</li>
				<li>Michael has double the amount of title drops as the next closest person, despite being missing from almost 2 full seasons. Michael has <strong>72</strong> title drops in the <strong>148</strong> episodes he appears in, so he title drops about once every 2 episodes. Michael also has the most title drops in any individual season he appears in, besides season 9 where he only has 2 lines.</li>
				<li>There were <strong>4</strong> one-time characters who title-dropped: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_On_(The_Office)" title="Episode 9x16, Moving On" target="_blank">Mark</a> (played by Bob Odenkirk; the man Pam interviews with for an office manager position in Philly), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_Committee" title="Episode 7x25-26, Search Committee" target="_blank">Merv</a> (played by Ray Romano; an interviewee to replace Michael as Scranton's regional manager), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counseling_(The_Office)" title="Episode 7x2, Counseling" target="_blank">window treatment guy</a> who is looking for the office administrator, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promos_(The_Office)" title="Episode 9x18, Promos" target="_blank">promo voice</a> for the meta documentary series.</li>
				<li>There are several main/starring/major recurring characters who don't title-drop at all: Phyllis (recurring in season 1, starring in season 2-9), Stanley (recurring in season 1, starring in season 2-9), Nellie (guest starring in season 7, starring in seasons 8-9), Karen (recurring in season 3, guest starring in seasons 4, 5, 7), Clark (starring in season 9), and Todd Packer (guest starring in season 1, 3, 6, 9; recurring in season 2, 7, 8).
