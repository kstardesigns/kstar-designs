			<h1>Title Drops - <em>The Office</em> edition</h1>

			<p><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="TV Tropes title drop page" target="_blank">Title</a> <a href="http://titledrops.xyz/post/150467309181/theofficeus" title="Check out lots more title drops here" target="_blank">drops</a> are when a TV show, movie, or other media mentions its own title in a line of dialogue. Among the top title-droppers are lots of TV shows that feature a main character's name as its title (think <em>Seinfeld</em>, <em>Roseanne</em>, <em>Reba</em>, <em>Newhart</em>, etc.). Similarly, <em>The Office</em> title drop count is also plentiful, since the simple title is also the location where most of the show takes place.</p>

			<p>Some quick stats: <em>The Office</em> title-drops <strong>222</strong> times in its <strong>201</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)_episodes" title="List of The Office (US) episodes on Wikipedia" target="_blank">*</a> episodes, or an average of <strong>1.1</strong> times per episode and <strong>24.7</strong> times per season. Frequent title-droppers unsurprisingly include Michael (<strong>72</strong> times): "This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office"; and Dwight (<strong>36</strong> times): "Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence." But there are also a few starring characters like Stanley and Phyllis, who appear in every season but don't title-drop at all. </p>

			<p>Now, on to the fun stuff: graphics and charts!</p>
