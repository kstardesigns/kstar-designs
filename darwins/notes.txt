Hey Matt,

I think I'm just about finished with the wholesale login functionality. Here's a quick rundown of what has been added to the site.

- The wholesale tab, on the header of the site. Click it to go to the wholesale login page

- The wholesale login page (http://kstardesigns.com/darwins/wholesale) - allows the user to log in, if they have an account. If not, there is a register link.

- The registration page (http://kstardesigns.com/darwins/wholesale/registration.php) - allows the user to sign up for an account, using their name, email, password, address.

- Forgot password page (http://kstardesigns.com/darwins/wholesale/forget.php) - this link is found on the wholesale login page, it allows the user to put their email in and they will be sent an email to reset their password

- The wholesale order page (http://kstardesigns.com/darwins/wholesale/order.php) - this is the page I showed you a preview image of. A user can add items to their order request. A list on the right summarizes their order, and they can also add an additional note if necessary. When they click 'Submit Order Request' it will send an email to you to let you know a new order request is available.

Let me know what you think of all this once you are able to view it and go through each page on a computer. It works well on phones too. 

By the way, thank you for the check, I received it yesterday. I will deposit it today.  I'm looking forward to seeing the product images and getting them on the site.

Thanks,
Kyle
