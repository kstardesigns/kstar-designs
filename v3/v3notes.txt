// TO DO: General //
- dont cut corners
- use all notes (while coding) on the live preview
- use code on codepen for computers, portfolio, stripes, footer
- make favicon, make all apple icons, fb image, etc
- use SCSS, mixins, break up css files if necessary
- make sure all -prefixes- are supported, and back up for ie8/9 if possible
- think of subtle things that would make it a 'featured' site
- maybe add css single div pics, like computer, in corner of striped sections
- look through css spec training, find ideas from those i haven't used
- do images for portfolio sites with 2x retina
- replace large svg if necessary
- make site accessible/friendly with alt, aria, other things
- fix mobile view of animated computer
- add bouncing down arrow to scroll


// TO DO: Later //
- find place for stat page, design a cool one
- highlight: orange
- custom scroll bar?
- add a 'jump to top' button. better yet, add a small circle following you on the right orange line. when hovering, it shows and arrow and jumps you to the top
- update /xyz to match the rest of new site 
- add a "click to copy" icon next to email address on hover
- add arrays of colors for portfolio computer/tablet/phone


// TO DO: Logo //:
- when hovered, some cool animation. (ie dark orange drops out, then slowly refills) (ie: http://codepen.io/gabriellewee/pen/zBoMGY )



// TO DO: Portfolio //:
- possibly think of a different way to switch between professional/personal projects
	Portfolio items:
- only change screen background images (probably via classes with diff bg images)
- change iphone and desktop with separate arrays of colors, at random
- 



// TO DO: Social icons //:
- reorder. twitter, linked, codepen, github, behance
- do a cool svg thing with social icons
- new footer idea. simple. http://codepen.io/mofny/pen/RWBeLJ



// TO DO: Menu //:
- when it's open, and link is clicked, close menu before jumping to section



// TO DO: Professional experience seciton //:
- Date consistency - dashes or "to"
- No italics
	Skills/professional experience:
- maybe add a small box-shadow on top/bottom like footer of cleo.com
- if possible, same height for both sections (
